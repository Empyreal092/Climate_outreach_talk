# Climate Outreach Talk

This is an outreach talk titled: *From greenhouse effect to the Paris Agreement: Exploring Manabeâ€™s Nobel-winning-work in predicting global warming*.

Abstract: We will take a tour through a hierarchy of climate models ranging from simplistic conceptual models of the greenhouse effect to complex computer simulations currently used for the IPCC reports, all predicting global warming is real and quantifiable. Our tour of history will also make clear the important contribution of Suki Manabe in the prediction of global warming, which won him the Nobel prize in 2021.
